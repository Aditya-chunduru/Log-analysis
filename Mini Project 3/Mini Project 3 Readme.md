Mini project 3: Log Analysis
CIS 153 L8
Program description: This program takes apache server log file as input and provides analytics on resources and requesters. 




I finally have completed this project. I had a really difficult time with getting the code to work as it should, I had many errors and it took alot of error checking just for my code to work. I also did alot of debugging and actually looking in to the log files to do reverse engineering of sortsI also had another really difficult roadblock which was finding out that my lab report results were innacurate and wrong. It didn't capture all the possible parts of the log file. Now i think my log file and results are actually accurate. In order to operate this program. Enter 2 when prompted if you want to analyze the default file. Enter 1 to choose a different log file. Make sure that if you enter 1, your chosen log file is in the folder where you have your code file. You probably have to specify your own file path in order to test this yourself. 


Modules needed to run the program: 

re which is for the regular expressions
pathlib which is for checking if a file exists.
